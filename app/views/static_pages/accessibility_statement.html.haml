  Compliance Status
  
%p.govuk-body 
  This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
 
%h2.govuk-heading 
  Non Accessible Content
  
%p.govuk-body 
  The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

%p.govuk-body 
  We know some parts of this website aren’t fully accessible:
%ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
  %li mobile-menu disappears when javascript is disabled
  %li screen readers on menu
  %li colour contrast insufficient for some links when highlighted by Tab
  %li with IE11, Mac/OS with Chrome and Firefox, the user needs to actually click Iinks within main content to access areas of learning, clicking surrounding area of a link does not work. 
  %li audio description of visual information

%p.govuk-body

%ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
  %li voice recognition
  %li with real users who have accessibility issues to make sure that our service meets their needs

%h2.govuk-heading 
  Non Compliance with the accessibility regulations
 
%p.govuk-body 
  The menu button (used for mobile) does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.3 (Focus order) as the Feedback link appears within focus order when javascript is disabled.  We are currently investigating this, and other menu button links that are within the focus order. 

%p.govuk-body 
  The menu button and associated menu links do not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value).  Screen readers are unable to tell when the menu items are expanded and collapsed, we are working on resolving these issues.

%p.govuk-body 
  Large controls we have for accessing learning areas do not work on IE11, Mac/OS with Chrome and Firefox, so the user will need to actually click the learning area link to access areas of learning.  

%p.govuk-body 
  The colour contrast is insufficient for some links when highlighted by Tab.  This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (contrast minimum). 

%p.govuk-body 
  We are investigating the audio description of visual information within videos.

%p.govuk-body 
  We have yet to test:
%ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
  %li voice recognition
  %li with real users who have accessibility issues to make sure that our service meets their needs

%p.govuk-body 
  We intend to address the above issues by the end of May 2021.
