## What the early years foundation stage (EYFS) framework says about communication and language
The development of children's spoken language underpins all seven areas of learning and development.

### Read more
Children's back-and-forth interactions from an early age form the foundations for language and cognitive development.
The number and quality of the conversations they have with adults and peers throughout the day in a language-rich environment is crucial.
By commenting on what children are interested in or doing, and echoing back what they say with new vocabulary added, practitioners will build children's language effectively.
Reading frequently to children, and engaging them actively in stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems, and then providing them with extensive opportunities to use and embed new words in a range of contexts, will give children the opportunity to thrive.
Through conversation, story-telling and role play, where children share their ideas with support and modelling from their teacher, and sensitive questioning that invites them to elaborate, children become comfortable using a rich range of vocabulary and language structures

Hundreds of hours of interactions enable a child to develop from babble, to words, to simple sentences.Studies show that once babies begin to understand words their vocabulary increases rapidly:

- at age one, children recognise about 50 words

- by age three, children recognise about 1,000 words

- by age five, children recognise at least 10,000 words

Having a large vocabulary helps children access more learning and allows them to make sense of the world around them. There are also lots of benefits from learning more than one language, including sign language.
Research has shown lots that can be done in the early years to avoid inequalities in children's language development. Children from more disadvantaged backgrounds are likely to have fewer vocabulary experiences than those from more affluent backgrounds. This 'word gap' is narrowed by adults providing a language rich environment full of stories, rhymes, songs and play with words that tune into the interests of young learners.  Removing this inequality is a priority for practitioners. Children can make good progress with early language development with the right support.
Children's language skills are strongly connected to a child's overall development and are a strong predictor of educational success. As speaking and listening develops children build foundations for literacy, for making sense of visual and verbal signs and ultimately for reading and writing.
Communication and language is one of the EYFS prime areas which means that it is one of the important building blocks for all other areas. It is time sensitive and if not developed early is very difficult to acquire later.

## What this means in practice
Strong language skills develop when children are part of playful, language rich environments with opportunities to learn new words. Hands-on experiences encourage learning and provide a context for new words to be explored. For example, learning vegetable names becomes easier when children are handling and/or tasting them.
Songs and rhymes offer fun ways to explore the sounds of words and notice patterns to support language learning. Poems with actions and repeated parts help children tune in to the structure of spoken language and explore the feel of new words.
Reading stories aloud and sharing books supports the development of language for thinking and understanding new concepts. Encouraging children to notice pictures, as well as understanding words, will strengthen language skills and widen vocabulary. Non-fiction and high quality texts encourage children to make sense of the world around them using language. Encouraging talk when sharing books is an excellent way to support communication and language.
Pretend play and acting out stories extends language and practitioners offering props and ideas can deepen the learning. This may include imaginative play with small world resources, open ended materials such as blocks or loose parts. Creativity and problem solving through interesting experiences like woodwork, painting, exploring, observing nature and music are all ways to encourage language for thinking and expressing ideas. Adults can be skilled communication partners alongside children to support their language journey.

## Suggested activities

### Dialogic book talk
Sharing a book with children is a fantastic way of exploring language together. Children will often want to talk about things they recognise, have already had experiences with and know about. Dialogic book talk is a way of encouraging children to make connections in their thinking when sharing and looking closely at the pages in a book. Allowing time to talk and think about what they notice in words and pictures, guided by an adult to extend vocabulary will help develop confident language skills.

### How does it work?
Dialogic book talk can work as a small group activity or one to one with an adult. It is a shared activity during which adults and children talk about a book together. Open ended questions that encourage children to notice and think whilst reading the book is an effective prompt to support them to talk more about what is being read and what is in the pictures.

### Exploring language through dialogic book talk
The adult listens carefully to the child and may repeat what the child says and expand their response eg. Child:"I can see a sheep" Adult: "Yes, I can see a fluffy sheep". This helps to encourage children's language confidence as well as introducing new vocabulary. Wondering questions can also extend children's thinking and encourage them to use their imagination and make predictions eg."I wonder what will happen to the farmer in the story?"

## Sensitively narrating children's play
We know children learn language when it is introduced to them sensitively, for example:

- at a time that is relevant to them

- in manageable amounts

- with plenty of time to process
One way of encouraging children's understanding, and later use, of verbal language is to offer examples to them as they play. Successfully narrating children's play will be supported through the use of key universal strategies:
**Expanding** – on what children say as you reply, adding one or two words. This shows the child you are interested and supports them to begin linking words and ideas in play. It can be helpful to remember that, if you ask the child one question and they are unable to reply, you may demonstrate responding by offering four comments. For example, 'what have you got?' (question) PAUSE 'It's a car', 'It's a red car', 'It's a red, fast car', 'It goes vrroomm!' (comments).
**Recasting** – (or modelling) back what the child says, in the right form, but without openly correcting them. For example, in the role play area, if a child said 'the baby sleeped in the bed' you might say 'oh, shhh, the baby's sleeping in the bed' to support the understanding of the complex relationships between grammar and vocabulary.
**Pausing** – allowing children extra time to respond, before speaking again. We know this supports language use as children's brains develop and fine-tune those important connections which enable them to receive and understand messages, before formulating and expressing their response.
It is important for practitioners to be flexible and responsive to different learning situations and interact in an authentic way having been invited into a child's play. This will help to ensure that thinking isn't interrupted and there is a sense of adult/child equality.

## What other nurseries and childminders are doing

### Supporting children with English as an Additional Language- Developing a shared context
Central to our practice is establishing a shared context to start the conversational journey. Planning learning experiences through the 'lens of accessibility' with lots of ways for EAL children to attend, participate and communicate without needing words. Visual signs, simple language and familiar routines all help. Children develop the motivation of being valued members of the group and can share their knowledge and interests with us, even if we don't share their language.
Familiar objects to model telling a story create a point of shared understanding and new vocabulary can be introduced. Natural, playful repetition found in all good story telling supports learners to thrive.

## Summary

-  Language development in the first years of life is critical to later educational success

- Communication and language is a prime area in the EYFS and is time sensitive which means that it is difficult to acquire later on

- Language development is best supported in a playful language environment full of stories, songs, rhymes, signs, talk and imaginative play

- Early years practitioners are well positioned in every day practice to narrow the word gap and support all children to make good progress

- Adults can be skilled communication partners alongside children to support their language journey.

## Next steps

- Consider how a team understanding of the stages of typical communication and language development could further improve our practice?

- Review how the environment (physical and emotional) meets all children's communication needs including non-verbal learners.

- Strengthen partnerships with parents and professionals to support children's speech, language and communication

## Why interactions are important

From birth, babies want to connect with others and are eager to interact. For example, babies might kick their legs ready to play a peekaboo game. These are important parts of an interaction to be noticed and encouraged by adults.
Being with others helps children to build social relationships which provide opportunities for friendship, empathy and sharing emotions.
Research shows that high-quality interactions between adults and children make a big difference to how well communication and language skills develop. Children benefit from the company of responsive and enthusiastic adults who are genuinely interested in talking to them.
In this video, an early years interactions expert explains what has changed within the early years foundation stage framework on interactions, and why. There are also some tips on getting the most out of a child in this area.

## What the early years foundation stage (EYFS) framework says
Children's back-and-forth interactions from an early age form the foundations for language and mental development.
The number and quality of the conversations they have with adults and other children throughout the day in a language-rich environment is crucial.
By commenting on what children are interested in or doing, and echoing back what they say with new vocabulary added, you will build children's language effectively.

## What this means in practice
The environment, relationships and the role of the adult are important factors in maintaining high-quality interactions with children.
High-quality interactions use:

- body language

- facial expressions

- actions

- songs

- words

Using objects, pictures or visual cues, such as showing a coat to indicate going outside, are good ways to support children who are non-verbal.
Taking turns and waiting for a child to respond builds confidence and independence. Being warm and attentive and adapting your language to meet the needs of individual children will maintain a conversation.
Adults that join in with children's play and comment, repeat back, wonder aloud and add new words will extend language in a powerful way.
You should plan the curriculum to maximise opportunities for these high-quality interactions and share ideas with parents to support the children at home.

## Suggested activities

### Daily routines
Make time for conversations based on children's interests during daily routines, for example, snack time.

1. Sit with children as you eat together so that you're well positioned to support conversations as part of the group. Plan the snack time routine so that it encourages independence and a relaxed, sociable atmosphere. Check that children can help themselves and reach what they need.

2. Allow plenty of time to encourage unrushed conversations. Notice all children's attempts to communicate and support those more reluctant to start an interaction, by being alongside and supporting them to be included.

3. Observe, wait and listen to tune in to what children are interested in and extend their communication by joining in and modelling a back and forth conversation. Use positive body language and facial expressions to encourage the conversation and add in some language to keep it going.

4. Remember what the children have talked about before to value previous conversations and start new ones based on what you know children's current interests are.

### Communication boxes

Encourage children to bring in shoe boxes filled with items from home to share and to talk about with you. You can make one too, as an example, to share with your group of children and parents.
The box may include:

- photographs of important people and pets

- a favourite toy or book

- items from a special trip or holiday
This encourages children to share and engage in meaningful interactions, about things that are important and familiar to them.
As part of this activity you might:

- introduce key vocabulary

- ask questions and allow children time to answer in order to learn more about the child and their family

- encourage children to practise using important vocabulary in a meaningful context
This activity will also help to develop the important relationships between you, the child and their family, which will support warm and positive interactions in the future.

## Other activities
Other activities to help develop high-quality interactions include:

- simple games like [blowing bubbles in this clip from the community children's health partnership](https://youtu.be/PgpddACbPSs) which can help children to take turns and communicate from an early age

- [speech language and communication strategies and resources](https://resources.leicestershire.gov.uk/education-and-children/early-years/childcare-practice/teaching-learning-and-assessment/every-child-a-talker-ecat/strategies-and-resources) from birth to 5

- a tool for practitioners to help [reflect on adult-child interactions](https://resources.leicestershire.gov.uk/sites/resource/files/field/pdf/2019/12/2/Adult-child-interaction-evaluation.pdf)

## How interactions are linked to the other areas of learning
Interactions underpin all areas of the EYFS as a tool to support learning and development. Ofsted's definition of teaching in the early years explains the different ways in which adults help young children learn, including: 'interactions with children during planned and child-initiated play and activities'.
Positive interactions that children have, both adult-child and child-child, encourage them to develop and share their ideas with others. Meaningful interactions with others also help them to learn and develop their understanding about themselves, others and the wider world around them. Communication and language development lays important foundations for later reading and writing skills.

## What other nurseries and childminders are doing

> "In practice we use 'Ask me about…' stickers to encourage communication through positive adult-child interactions. Practitioners will write a brief note on a sticker about something interesting each child has done at pre-school that day and give it to the child to share. Children and their parents or carers can then talk about it together on their way home. The intention was to spark discussion, create opportunities for meaningful interactions, and develop those important two-way relationships between early years providers and home."

> Noah's Ark Preschool - a charity-run preschool, operating in one room with free-flow access to outdoors, for children aged 2 to 4 years.

## Summary

- Children are born to communicate and will seek out interaction.

- Quality interactions and conversations depend on social relationships and tuned-in adults.

- A well planned language rich environment is important to facilitate high-quality interactions.

- Planning and reflecting on the quality and time available for conversations will increase opportunities for learning language and communication skills.

- Listening, asking open questions, commenting, repeating, extending, adapting, and valuing non-verbal communication all support children's communication.

## Next steps

- How do you make time and space for conversations based on the interests of children?

- How might peer observation, observing practice and feeding back, support the quality of adult-child interactions?

- How do you ensure all practitioners' interactions are consistent in their support for children's communication and language?

- How do you make sure that adult-child interactions reflect the individual communication needs of the unique child?

- How do you know that the learning environments inside and out are organised to enable communication and talk?
