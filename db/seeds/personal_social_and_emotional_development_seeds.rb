### What the early years foundation stage (EYFS) framework says about personal, social and emotional development

Children’s personal, social and emotional development (PSED) is crucial for children to lead healthy and happy lives, and is fundamental to their cognitive development.

### Read more

Underpinning their personal development are the important attachments that shape their social world.

Strong, warm and supportive relationships with adults enable children to learn how to understand their own feelings and those of others.

Children should be supported to manage emotions, develop a positive sense of self, set themselves simple goals, have confidence in their own abilities, to persist and wait for what they want and direct attention as necessary.

Through adult modelling and guidance, they will learn how to look after their bodies, including healthy eating, and manage personal needs independently.

Through supported interaction with other children they learn how to make good friendships, co-operate and resolve conflicts peaceably.

These attributes will provide a secure platform from which children can achieve at school and in later life.

Understanding children’s emotional worlds are critical to understanding their behaviour. Early years children feel a range of emotions, but often cannot articulate, interpret or process them like us.

With poor emotional skills, it could be harder for children to learn acceptance, resilience, authenticity, well-being, identity and sense of self.

Research shows that from conception, experiences and responses from adults strongly influence how children self-regulate and deal with emotions. Emotionally present adults, who support children’s development, are important. Meeting children’s emotions is critical, even when some are harder to understand than others, and evoke strong feelings in us.

Containment, or being ‘held’, is particularly important. This can mean physically being held safe, or also ‘held in mind’. This helps children feel that they are not alone, are supported and can safely tackle issues.

Behaviour is often an expression of feelings or emotions, met or unmet. To help children make sense of this, and to have the best effect, you should approach them with empathy, supporting and guiding them to identify and deal with their emotions.

In this video, an early years emotions expert explains what has changed within the early years foundation stage framework on emotions, and why. There are also some tips on getting the most out of a child in this area.

##What the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Framework says

Strong, warm and supportive relationships with adults enable children to learn how to understand their own feelings and those of others. Children should be supported to manage emotions, develop a positive sense of self, set themselves simple goals, have confidence in their own abilities, to persist and wait for what they want and direct attention as necessary.

##What this means in practice

To best meet and support children’s emotions, be playful, light, warm, accepting, and curious. Create genuine connection and show authentic empathy. Listen fully to what a child tells you, with their body language, actions, sounds and words.

Support children’s development by providing words and meanings to name and express emotions. With these, they can practice how to handle their emotions as they arise.

Provide an emotionally consistent response, following basic emotional coaching steps:

- recognition

- empathy

- validation by labelling feelings

- offering guidance or boundaries

- problem solving

Support self-expression opportunities throughout the day, through stories, drawing, crafts, roleplay and general play, while naming feelings with visual supports.

Your physical environment should offer emotional containment: cosy, homely, communication-friendly spaces that children can explore. This should be complemented by children choosing what they do, with opportunities to take safe risks and immerse their senses.

You should have your own safe space to reflect, as children’s emotional needs can evoke your own responses.

##Suggested activities

###Naming emotions - visual support

What you need:

- Laminated expressive emotion faces, including photos of children, their families, you or other nursery staff.

- Laminated feelings cards you can carry, as well as an extra set with Velcro backs for a feelings board.

- A feelings board, to stick feelings cards to.

- A laminated thermometer, to show emotion levels.

Instructions:

Use the daily routine to support children in naming their emotions, for instance:

- use feelings cards to ask children how they are as they arrive and separate, involving parents and carers where possible. Then, talk about how children feel as a group

- use the thermometer or feelings cards when children try tricky new things, like climbing or building something, or during a day transition they find difficult

- when there are conflicts, use feelings cards to help children express and name their related emotions

- when sharing a story, song or circle time activity which mentions a particular emotion, use feelings cards to connect children to it

Adapting the activity:

- These ongoing activities are accessible to children at every developmental stage.

- Support children by meeting their emotion, mirroring and modelling feelings and responses.

Challenging the children:

- Children confident with expressing and understanding emotions will start to empathise with others, modelling curiosity, guidance and solutions.

- Encourage children through peer conflict resolution.

- Invite children to anticipate arising feelings for themselves and others in specific contexts, such as stories, role play or transitions.

Outcomes:

- Increase in confidence.

- Expressing and labelling various emotions.

- Stronger independence and confidence, with providers and other children.

- Improving emotions vocabulary.
- Showing increasing self-control, better self-regulation.

- Developing a stronger sense of self.

###The child's emotion story

What you need:

- Laminated photographs of the child playing, their family, favourite objects or characters.

- Laminated visual timetable cards, representing daily routine.

- Laminated feelings cards.

- Paper, card, pens etc.

Instructions:

- A best-known adult creates a simple, laminated book. The front page features the child’s face, name and favourite things, so it’s personal and unique.

- A basic narrative follows specific challenge stages, such as tidy-up time, saying goodbye to parents and carers, interactions with other children.

- Use short, simple sentences and clear language.

- Refer to feelings throughout, with words and symbols, for example ‘tidy-up time is noisy, which can make me feel worried.’

- Create 2 copies, 1 for them to read at nursery, alongside an adult or independently. The other goes home, to share with family.

Adapting the activity:

This activity supports children facing specific emotional challenges, for instance biting, or a fear of something specific.

You can adapt it for other situations, including:

- understanding the daily routine

- a new setting or transition to school

- preparing for a change of routine. trip out

- daily routine difficulties, such as arriving at nursery

Challenging the children:

As children develop and reflect on their emotions, additional stories can be made with you or other children, developing on language and feelings.

Outcomes:

- Children mentally rehearse parts of the daily routine that could cause adverse emotional responses, increasing their feelings of familiarity, safety and confidence.

- Children are able to reflect on difficult experiences and feelings in an emotionally safe way, from a ‘distance’ and alongside an emotionally attuned adult.

- Children build on their emotional literacy and develop a growing ability to recognise and name feelings as they arise.

- Children develop increasing awareness and control over their feelings, and can begin to develop and use strategies to cope when feelings overwhelm them, such as asking an adult for help.

###Non-Verbal Storying

What you need:

- Various junk modelling materials, such as newspaper, cardboard boxes and tubes.

- A large whiteboard or paper

- A simple script based on a familiar conflict, such as sharing, or their parent or carer leaving them in the morning

Instructions:

- Gather the children for storytime.

- Draw their attention to a masking tape line on the floor, a ‘stage’ area.

- Use modelling materials to create characters and props in front of children, as the story takes place.

- Focus on an emotional learning aspect that challenges children, such as sharing, or their parent or carer leaving them in the morning, following a basic 3 point story arc:
  - setup
  - problem
  - solution

- Use words, voices, expression in your voice and drawn symbols or faces to signal thoughts and feelings.

- Pause throughout for ‘I wonder’ moments, allowing children to contribute ideas around character feelings or potential resolutions.

Adapting the activity:

- This storytelling style supports many curriculum areas, providing an inclusive platform to explore feelings, learning and experiences.

- Very effective for early literacy. By retelling and innovating familiar stories, children develop narrative understanding, empowering them to tell their own stories.

Challenging the children:

- Leave resources available after the story, so children can explore. Use pre-made characters to re-tell, improve or invent stories, or create new props and characters.



Outcomes:

- The non-verbal aspect enables children to access and engage at their level, regardless of developmental stage or home language.

- Children tune in to non-verbal prompts, recognising and identifying others feelings.

- Children can reflect on difficult situations from a safe distance, developing empathy towards others.

- Children develop strategies to express and communicate their feelings.

- Children learn practical steps to resolve conflict, such as using a sand-timer to support sharing.

##How emotions are linked to the other areas of learning

Supporting children’s emotional development and wellbeing is linked to all EYFS areas of learning. Without emotional resilience, a child might not learn with confidence and control, connect or empathise with others, or adequately articulate experiences.

##What other nurseries and childminders are doing
> “Children can explore emotions through curiosity and literature, which lets them share their thoughts and feelings with confidence during circle time. They are encouraged to build on emotional knowledge - receiving time, attention and comfort by caregivers, and feeling heard.”
>
> Hannah Nevill, Preschool Teacher, Daisychain Nursery Clifton.


> “Through regular emotion symbol and Makaton sign use, children learn that we all have an emotional range. They recognise this range in themselves and their peers, while realising that emotions are separate from behaviour. Emotions are all acceptable, and we receive them with compassion, support and understanding.”
>
> Provider from Brentry and Henbury Childrens Centre, Bristol.

##Summary

- Children need emotionally safe relationships and environments, to explore their emotions.

- You should be emotionally present and available, supporting children by recognising, understanding, regulating and expressing emotions.

- Children’s behaviour can often be a result of an emotion or unmet need.

- You need time, support and space to consider how children’s emotions and behaviour evoke their own feelings and responses.

##Next Steps

- Reflect on your environment and daily routine, and how these support children and their emotions.

- Create and keep visual prompts, to support children expressing emotions through storytelling.

- Practice potential steps, or a sample script, that could support children to manage their emotions. Share this with parents and carers.

- Consider your personal, social and emotional development policies, making sure emotional development and needs are clear.

- Consider talking about how children’s emotional outbursts make you feel with other providers.

markdown_for_sense_of_self = <<-MARKDOWN_FOR_SENSE_OF_SELF

Babies develop a sense of self by interacting with others and by exploring their bodies and objects around them, indoors and outdoors.

These feelings of identity grow as adults tune in to children’s thoughts. If these attempts are successful, children will feel understood. A sense of self arises from the experience of being in the mind of others.

If children do not feel understood this can have major consequences for feelings of intimacy, trust and attachment later on.

You will find that sharing everyday experiences supports children’s understanding of social interactions. Childcare settings are where children can meet new adults and other children.

Human behaviour is motivated by a desire to belong and find a place in the group, in our families, neighbourhoods, schools and society.

Relationships with others will help children understand that they have a place in society. Supporting children to feel good about themselves and the choices they make increases their confidence. Children need to explore their own potential to discover new things and develop their knowledge and interests.

Encourage the children in your home or nursery setting to make choices. You should offer a rich selection of activities planned around a child’s individual interests.

In this video, an early years expert explains what has changed within the early years foundation stage framework on sense of self, and why. There are also some tips on getting the most out of a child in this area.

##What the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Framework says

Strong, warm and supportive relationships with adults enable children to learn how to understand their own feelings and those of others. Children should be supported to manage emotions, develop a positive sense of self, set themselves simple goals, have confidence in their own abilities, to persist and wait for what they want and direct attention as necessary.

##What this means in practice

Be patient and attentive. The way you interact with children will encourage their sense of themselves and self-confidence. Knowing each child is the key to supporting their sense of self so plan the environment to reflect their interests.

Make sure children know where everything is in the setting. It helps to offer them continuity and consistency. In turn this supports children to use the environment independently.

A predictable routine encourages a secure sense of self. Giving children advance notice that things are going to change helps them feel prepared.

Share information with families to prepare children for anything out of the ordinary.

##Suggested activities

###Look at me

Seeing their own image is interesting to children. After the age of one most children can tell the difference between themselves and someone else’s image in a mirror.

By the age of 2 children can recognise themselves in photos or video and recognise others. Older children can take photos or perhaps videos of themselves and their friends.

You could:

- provide opportunities for children and babies to see their own image

- take photos of children and display them in a book or on the walls or take a video of them and watch it back with them

- listen intently to what they say about themselves

- see if they recognise themselves

- take a photo or video of them alongside other familiar adults or children

- see if they can tell the difference between themselves and someone else

- see if the children can make comparisons between their own bodies and images and the bodies and images of others

These comparisons help them gain a growing understanding of the distinction between themselves and others.

Older children who are capable of using a camera or video could be encouraged to gather the footage themselves.

Watch it back with them and listen to what they say. This will give you an idea of what is meaningful to them.

###Making books

Young children like seeing photos of themselves in books. For a child to see a picture of themselves when they were a baby is fascinating.

When you pull out a child’s picture album and look through the pictures one by one, describing them you are building a story for the child.

The book can be built upon and developed as the child develops. The child is recounting memories that form their own history.

Personal stories and memories will shape how they think and feel about themselves in the years to come.

###Other activities

[Supporting children’s sense of agency.](https://keikiearlylearning.com.au/supporting-childrens-sense-of-agency/)

##How sense of self is linked to other areas of learning

A sense of self relates to all 6 other areas of learning.

Children who have a good sense of self can challenge themselves mentally and physically.

They will be better able to understand their social environment and have an understanding of the world.

If children have a sense of security in their relationships then their communication and language skills will be stronger.

Inner confidence helps children to give things a go and keep trying.

##What other nurseries and childminders are doing

> “In our childcare setting each child has their own special box. They can put whatever they want in it, for example their blanket or a toy car.”
>
> Key worker, Pengreen centre, Corby

> “As key workers we ‘hold’ children in mind, caring for them as individuals and remembering what happened to them before. If they leave on a Friday having told us they are going to a birthday party at the weekend we will talk to them on Monday about it. We will also make sure we remember the important people in their lives.”
>
> Key worker, Kingswood nursery, Corby

##Summary

Children who have a sense of self can challenge themselves. This helps them become independent and secure to face challenges in areas of learning.

If children do not feel a sense of security, they will not be able to settle into their environment and will struggle to learn or develop.

If you respond to children and try to understand their feelings, they will feel safe. A feeling of safety encourages children to be their own person and take part in the experiences on offer.

Children need to try out different ways for asserting themselves and keeping themselves safe.

##Next steps

Consider this as a possible activity to examine how well you know each child. This will help you develop an awareness of their sense of self. We suggest doing this every half term and going back to revisit it. Keep a file for each child in your care.

###Do you know me?

Imagine the child is asking you these questions. What would you answer on the child’s behalf?

- Do you know me?

- Can I trust you?

- Do you hear me?

- Will you let me fly?

- Is this a fair place for me?

Consider how your environment supports children to play independently.
