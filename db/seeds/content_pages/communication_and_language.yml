    ## What the early years foundation stage (EYFS) framework says about communication and language

    The development of children's spoken language underpins all seven areas of learning and development.

    ### Read more

    Children's back-and-forth interactions from an early age form the foundations for language and cognitive development.

    The number and quality of the conversations they have with adults and peers throughout the day in a language-rich environment is crucial.

    By commenting on what children are interested in or doing, and echoing back what they say with new vocabulary added, practitioners will build children's language effectively.

    Reading frequently to children, and engaging them actively in stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems, and then providing them with extensive opportunities to use and embed new words in a range of contexts, will give children the opportunity to thrive.

    Through conversation, story-telling and role play, where children share their ideas with support and modelling from their teacher, and sensitive questioning that invites them to elaborate, children become comfortable using a rich range of vocabulary and language structures

    ## Why interactions are important

    From birth, babies want to connect with others and are eager to interact. For example, babies might kick their legs ready to play a peekaboo game. These are important parts of an interaction to be noticed and encouraged by adults.
    Being with others helps children to build social relationships which provide opportunities for friendship, empathy and sharing emotions.
    Research shows that high-quality interactions between adults and children make a big difference to how well communication and language skills develop. Children benefit from the company of responsive and enthusiastic adults who are genuinely interested in talking to them.
    In this video, an early years interactions expert explains what has changed within the early years foundation stage framework on interactions, and why. There are also some tips on getting the most out of a child in this area.

    ## What the early years foundation stage (EYFS) framework says
    Children's back-and-forth interactions from an early age form the foundations for language and mental development.
    The number and quality of the conversations they have with adults and other children throughout the day in a language-rich environment is crucial.
    By commenting on what children are interested in or doing, and echoing back what they say with new vocabulary added, you will build children's language effectively.

    ## What this means in practice
    The environment, relationships and the role of the adult are important factors in maintaining high-quality interactions with children.
    High-quality interactions use:

    - body language

    - facial expressions

    - actions

    - songs

    - words

    Using objects, pictures or visual cues, such as showing a coat to indicate going outside, are good ways to support children who are non-verbal.
    Taking turns and waiting for a child to respond builds confidence and independence. Being warm and attentive and adapting your language to meet the needs of individual children will maintain a conversation.
    Adults that join in with children's play and comment, repeat back, wonder aloud and add new words will extend language in a powerful way.
    You should plan the curriculum to maximise opportunities for these high-quality interactions and share ideas with parents to support the children at home.

    ## Suggested activities

    ### Daily routines

    Make time for conversations based on children's interests during daily routines, for example, snack time.

    1. Sit with children as you eat together so that you're well positioned to support conversations as part of the group. Plan the snack time routine so that it encourages independence and a relaxed, sociable atmosphere. Check that children can help themselves and reach what they need.

    2. Allow plenty of time to encourage unrushed conversations. Notice all children's attempts to communicate and support those more reluctant to start an interaction, by being alongside and supporting them to be included.

    3. Observe, wait and listen to tune in to what children are interested in and extend their communication by joining in and modelling a back and forth conversation. Use positive body language and facial expressions to encourage the conversation and add in some language to keep it going.

    4. Remember what the children have talked about before to value previous conversations and start new ones based on what you know children's current interests are.

    ### Communication boxes

    Encourage children to bring in shoe boxes filled with items from home to share and to talk about with you. You can make one too, as an example, to share with your group of children and parents.
    The box may include:

    - photographs of important people and pets

    - a favourite toy or book

    - items from a special trip or holiday
    This encourages children to share and engage in meaningful interactions, about things that are important and familiar to them.
    As part of this activity you might:

    - introduce key vocabulary

    - ask questions and allow children time to answer in order to learn more about the child and their family

    - encourage children to practise using important vocabulary in a meaningful context
    This activity will also help to develop the important relationships between you, the child and their family, which will support warm and positive interactions in the future.

    ## Other activities

    Other activities to help develop high-quality interactions include:

    - simple games like [blowing bubbles in this clip from the community children's health partnership](https://youtu.be/PgpddACbPSs) which can help children to take turns and communicate from an early age

    ## How interactions are linked to the other areas of learning

    Interactions underpin all areas of the EYFS as a tool to support learning and development. Ofsted's definition of teaching in the early years explains the different ways in which adults help young children learn, including: 'interactions with children during planned and child-initiated play and activities'.

    Positive interactions that children have, both adult-child and child-child, encourage them to develop and share their ideas with others. Meaningful interactions with others also help them to learn and develop their understanding about themselves, others and the wider world around them. Communication and language development lays important foundations for later reading and writing skills.

    ## What other nurseries and childminders are doing

    > "In practice we use 'Ask me about…' stickers to encourage communication through positive adult-child interactions. Practitioners will write a brief note on a sticker about something interesting each child has done at pre-school that day and give it to the child to share. Children and their parents or carers can then talk about it together on their way home. The intention was to spark discussion, create opportunities for meaningful interactions, and develop those important two-way relationships between early years providers and home."

    ## Summary

    - Children are born to communicate and will seek out interaction.

    - Quality interactions and conversations depend on social relationships and tuned-in adults.

    - A well planned language rich environment is important to facilitate high-quality interactions.

    - Planning and reflecting on the quality and time available for conversations will increase opportunities for learning language and communication skills.

    - Listening, asking open questions, commenting, repeating, extending, adapting, and valuing non-verbal communication all support children's communication.

    ## Next steps

    - How do you make time and space for conversations based on the interests of children?

    - How might peer observation, observing practice and feeding back, support the quality of adult-child interactions?

    - How do you ensure all practitioners' interactions are consistent in their support for children's communication and language?

    - How do you make sure that adult-child interactions reflect the individual communication needs of the unique child?

    - How do you know that the learning environments inside and out are organised to enable communication and talk?

    Hundreds of hours of interactions enable a child to develop from babble, to words, to simple sentences.Studies show that once babies begin to understand words their vocabulary increases rapidly:

    - at age one, children recognise about 50 words

    - by age three, children recognise about 1,000 words

    - by age five, children recognise at least 10,000 words

    Having a large vocabulary helps children access more learning and allows them to make sense of the world around them. There are also lots of benefits from learning more than one language, including sign language.

    Research has shown lots that can be done in the early years to avoid inequalities in children's language development. Children from more disadvantaged backgrounds are likely to have fewer vocabulary experiences than those from more affluent backgrounds. This 'word gap' is narrowed by adults providing a language rich environment full of stories, rhymes, songs and play with words that tune into the interests of young learners.  Removing this inequality is a priority for practitioners. Children can make good progress with early language development with the right support.

    Children's language skills are strongly connected to a child's overall development and are a strong predictor of educational success. As speaking and listening develops children build foundations for literacy, for making sense of visual and verbal signs and ultimately for reading and writing.

    Communication and language is one of the EYFS prime areas which means that it is one of the important building blocks for all other areas. It is time sensitive and if not developed early is very difficult to acquire later.

    ## What this means in practice

    Strong language skills develop when children are part of playful, language rich environments with opportunities to learn new words. Hands-on experiences encourage learning and provide a context for new words to be explored. For example, learning vegetable names becomes easier when children are handling and/or tasting them.

    Songs and rhymes offer fun ways to explore the sounds of words and notice patterns to support language learning. Poems with actions and repeated parts help children tune in to the structure of spoken language and explore the feel of new words.

    Reading stories aloud and sharing books supports the development of language for thinking and understanding new concepts. Encouraging children to notice pictures, as well as understanding words, will strengthen language skills and widen vocabulary. Non-fiction and high quality texts encourage children to make sense of the world around them using language. Encouraging talk when sharing books is an excellent way to support communication and language.

    Pretend play and acting out stories extends language and practitioners offering props and ideas can deepen the learning. This may include imaginative play with small world resources, open ended materials such as blocks or loose parts. Creativity and problem solving through interesting experiences like woodwork, painting, exploring, observing nature and music are all ways to encourage language for thinking and expressing ideas. Adults can be skilled communication partners alongside children to support their language journey.

    ## Suggested activities

    ### Dialogic book talk

    Sharing a book with children is a fantastic way of exploring language together. Children will often want to talk about things they recognise, have already had experiences with and know about. Dialogic book talk is a way of encouraging children to make connections in their thinking when sharing and looking closely at the pages in a book. Allowing time to talk and think about what they notice in words and pictures, guided by an adult to extend vocabulary will help develop confident language skills.

    ### How does it work?

    Dialogic book talk can work as a small group activity or one to one with an adult. It is a shared activity during which adults and children talk about a book together. Open ended questions that encourage children to notice and think whilst reading the book is an effective prompt to support them to talk more about what is being read and what is in the pictures.

    ### Exploring language through dialogic book talk

    The adult listens carefully to the child and may repeat what the child says and expand their response eg. Child:"I can see a sheep" Adult: "Yes, I can see a fluffy sheep". This helps to encourage children's language confidence as well as introducing new vocabulary. Wondering questions can also extend children's thinking and encourage them to use their imagination and make predictions eg."I wonder what will happen to the farmer in the story?"

    ## Sensitively narrating children's play

    We know children learn language when it is introduced to them sensitively, for example:

    - at a time that is relevant to them

    - in manageable amounts

    - with plenty of time to process

    One way of encouraging children's understanding, and later use, of verbal language is to offer examples to them as they play. Successfully narrating children's play will be supported through the use of key universal strategies:

    **Expanding** – on what children say as you reply, adding one or two words. This shows the child you are interested and supports them to begin linking words and ideas in play. It can be helpful to remember that, if you ask the child one question and they are unable to reply, you may demonstrate responding by offering four comments. For example, 'what have you got?' (question) PAUSE 'It's a car', 'It's a red car', 'It's a red, fast car', 'It goes vrroomm!' (comments).

    **Recasting** – (or modelling) back what the child says, in the right form, but without openly correcting them. For example, in the role play area, if a child said 'the baby sleeped in the bed' you might say 'oh, shhh, the baby's sleeping in the bed' to support the understanding of the complex relationships between grammar and vocabulary.

    **Pausing** – allowing children extra time to respond, before speaking again. We know this supports language use as children's brains develop and fine-tune those important connections which enable them to receive and understand messages, before formulating and expressing their response.

    It is important for practitioners to be flexible and responsive to different learning situations and interact in an authentic way having been invited into a child's play. This will help to ensure that thinking isn't interrupted and there is a sense of adult/child equality.

    ## What other nurseries and childminders are doing

    ### Supporting children with English as an Additional Language- Developing a shared context

    Central to our practice is establishing a shared context to start the conversational journey. Planning learning experiences through the 'lens of accessibility' with lots of ways for EAL children to attend, participate and communicate without needing words. Visual signs, simple language and familiar routines all help. Children develop the motivation of being valued members of the group and can share their knowledge and interests with us, even if we don't share their language.

    Familiar objects to model telling a story create a point of shared understanding and new vocabulary can be introduced. Natural, playful repetition found in all good story telling supports learners to thrive.

    ## Summary

    -  Language development in the first years of life is critical to later educational success

    - Communication and language is a prime area in the EYFS and is time sensitive which means that it is difficult to acquire later on

    - Language development is best supported in a playful language environment full of stories, songs, rhymes, signs, talk and imaginative play

    - Early years practitioners are well positioned in every day practice to narrow the word gap and support all children to make good progress

    - Adults can be skilled communication partners alongside children to support their language journey.

    ## Next steps

    - Consider how a team understanding of the stages of typical communication and language development could further improve our practice?

    - Review how the environment (physical and emotional) meets all children's communication needs including non-verbal learners.

    - Strengthen partnerships with parents and professionals to support children's speech, language and communication

    ##Why listening and understanding is important

    Communication requires 2 foundation skills, listening and understanding. Children develop these by observing and reacting to others. This influences communication and talking later in life.

    Listening is different to simply hearing. It means interpreting different sounds, while beginning to understand social interactions. Understanding means processing what’s being communicated, beginning with simple ideas and vocabulary.

    Most babies are born able and eager to interact, but some need extra support. You can play an important part in all children’s overall communication development. Listen to children’s interests and engage in warm interactions with them. Use children’s names to get their attention and keep it.

    Children should develop close listening and attention skills, so do not have music on all the time. Think also about playing a variety of sounds, such as environmental noises like rain or the rainforest, as well as stories and rhymes.

    In return listen closely to the children. Attend to their wants, needs and individual interests. Children will feel their input is valued, and that they’re appropriately supported. They’ll be much more motivated to listen, understand and learn from others.

    ##What the EYFS framework says

    By commenting on what children are interested in or doing, and echoing back what they say with new vocabulary added, practitioners will build children's language effectively. Reading frequently to children, and engaging them actively in stories, non-fiction, rhymes and poems, and then providing them with extensive opportunities to use and embed new words in a range of contexts, will give children the opportunity to thrive.

    [Statutory framework for the early years foundation stage](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2), page 8.

    ##What this means in practice

    To support early listening and understanding, consider your setting's physical and emotional environment. Children should be able to practise listening closely, and be encouraged to focus their attention. They will benefit from a quiet environment when they are learning to listen and understand. There are different attention stages:

    - Generally between 0 and 1 year, children are easily distracted. Keep their attention by giving them your full attention. Demonstrate focus when playing with and responding to them. Use wait-and-see activities such as 'peek-a-boo'.
    - Generally between 1 and 2 years, children can keep focus but cannot shift it alone. Support early understanding with instructions, gestures and prompts, for example showing a child their nappy before changing it. Respond to their play and words, to help them concentrate and listen.
    - Generally between 2 and 3 years, children can shift focus between tasks more easily. However, they will need your support. Do this through light touch and using their name.
    - Generally between 3 and 4 years, children pay attention to different things at the same time. However they may still find this difficult and need support. Use clear prompts to help them switch their attention between tasks and listen to instructions. Something like calling their name, followed by a simple sentence like ‘please stop and listen’ would work well. This prepares them for the more structured learning in the reception year.

    ##Suggested activities

    ###Songs to encourage sound and word play

    ![A practitioner signing to children with actions](https://help-for-early-years-providers.education.gov.uk/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBc0VCIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--53e8be06657d44fab1e460fa52d864706c174564/comms&lang_listening_activity1%20(1).jpg "A practitioner signing to children with actions")

    Children love singing silly songs, especially involving actions, movement and laughter. Playing around with sounds can develop listening skills in a fun way, encouraging confidence with new words. Changing words in familiar songs is great fun, and children can consider the sound differences they hear.

    You’ll need some of your favourite songs that have easy words to play with.

    Try these examples of song word play:

    - ’Polly puts the pizza in’, to the tune of ‘Polly put the kettle on’. Change the verses with different children’s names, such as:
      -  ‘Suzie sizzles sausages’
      -  ‘Ben bites biscuits bit by bit’
      -  ‘Carly crunches cabbages’
    - ’A Hedgehog is very prickly’ - to the tune of ‘One finger, one thumb, keep moving’.
      - ’A hedgehog is very prickly
      - A hedgehog is very prickly,
      - A hedgehog is very prickly
      - He couldn’t be anything else!’

    Choose a new animal, changing the describing word each time, such as ‘a crocodile is very snappy’, ‘a kitten is very fluffy’.

    You can choose whichever songs you like, in line with current classroom themes or children’s special interests.

    These song examples are from ‘Bingo Lingo’, by Helen MacGregor.

    ###How this activity links to the other areas of learning

    Children can learn different ways of using songs and words [(widening vocabulary)](/understanding-the-world/widening-vocabulary). They will consider how similar sounds can be amusing [(comprehension)](/literacy/reading-comprehension). They can explore the fun of song and performance [(expressive arts and design)](/expressive-arts-and-design). They can learn how to work with others while having fun and learning [relationships](/personal-social-and-emotional-development/relationships).

    ###Listening treasure boxes

    You’ll need items that make interesting noises in a 'treasure box', for example:

    - crinkly paper
    - noise-making toys
    - pots and pans
    - musical instruments

    Introduce the box to a small group of children, encouraging them to explore the items.

    Listen carefully to individual sounds as the children take turns. Turn-taking is also an important communication skill, needing careful listening.

    With older, more capable children, get them to take turns bringing an item behind a screen, making the noise while the group guesses what it might be.

    Once the group is familiar with all items, take one away and ask if they can remember, replicating or even describing its noise.

    The box can be left out for children to explore freely, with positive interactions from you to support listening development.

    ###How the activity links to other areas of learning

    Children can learn how to hold instruments and other noise-making materials [(fine motor skills)](/physical-development/fine-motor-skills). They can arrange the best way to cooperate with friends and take turns [(relationships)](/personal-social-and-emotional-development/relationships). They can develop their memory skills to think about which items might be missing [(patterns and connections)](/mathematics/patterns-and-connections). They can develop their skills around music and performance [(expressive arts and design)](/expressive-arts-and-design).

    ##What other nurseries and childminders are doing

    ^”We use ‘sound bags’ in focused small groups, suitable for children 15 to 18 months, but easily adapted. Use a calm, quiet, distraction-free space. For smaller settings, this may be whilst other children are napping or engaged in independent activities. Gather some objects in a bag, represented by a sound. Choose familiar or motivational objects for a specific child, such as their favourite animal. Get children’s attention by showing the bag, bringing objects out one-by-one and making the sound. Let the chosen child hold and play with each object, providing a multi-sensory approach. Ask them to take turns listening and finding objects for each sound. If a child seems comfortable, encourage them to make the object’s sound themselves, but do not force this. To adapt to each child’s needs, use signs or symbols, rather than sounds, and encourage them to explore objects using the sense they rely on most.”^

    Amy, Pen Green Centre, Northamptonshire.

    ##Summary

    - Basic communication begins with two important skills: listening, and understanding.
    - Listening and understanding are the foundation for later learning and development, for example talking, writing, and communicating with friends.
    - Good listening and understanding helps with all EYFS areas, particularly developing social skills, attention, following instructions and wider communication.
    - Babies, toddlers and young children must develop the ability to focus and maintain concentration, in order to learn.
    - Listening, which is different to hearing, means interpreting sounds and understanding their source, as well as meaning.

    ##Next steps

    - Consider your setting’s physical and emotional environment.
    - Consider opportunities for children to listen and understand sounds.
    - Discuss the importance of listening and understanding with parents and carers.
    - Notice and make time for listening and understanding during everyday interactions.
