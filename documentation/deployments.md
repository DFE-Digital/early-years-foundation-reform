### Deployment

Github workflow is used to deploy to environments on Gov.uk PaaS.

Upon merging a PR to `main` a deployment to the development environment will be triggered. This will:

1. Checkout the branch
1. Login to Docker Hub
1. Build docker image
1. Upload docker image to Docker Hub
1. Initialise Terraform
1. Run the Terraform plan
1. Apply the Terraform changes

### PaaS

Some useful things to know about PaaS...

GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud-hosting platform built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). GOV.UK PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services and background tasks so you donâ€™t need to hire people with specialist cloud skills.

GOV.UK PaaS uses the open source Cloud Foundry project, and runs on Amazon Web Services.

This repo has an organisation setup on PaaS. Speak to the org manager to authorise the [creation of a personal account](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/get_started.html#get-started)

The Cloud Coundry CLI can be used to manage apps hosted on PaaS - [Setup Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/get_started.html#set-up-the-cloud-foundry-command-line)

### Environments

This application runs through four environments:

- dev
- test
- pre prod
- prod

`dev` is deployed to automatically when a PR is merged into the `main` branch.

`test`, `pre prod` and `prod` deployments are triggered manually from the Github workflow tab

Each environment has a dedicated PaaS user account to run CI/CD jobs using Github workflows.

To find out the user account details, contact the org manager.

### Seed data

[Seed data is destroyed](../db/seeds.rb) and recreated in `dev`, `test` and `pre prod` environments.

`prod` does not get seeded with data automatically.

### Environment variables

The application requires the following environment variables to deploy to an environment:

- TF_VAR_paas_app_docker_image
- TF_VAR_paas_user
- TF_VAR_paas_password
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

They are stored in github secrets and consumed by the deploy jobs.

### Databases

The application is backed by a [PostgreSQL database hosted on PaaS](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/postgresql/#postgresql).

The Conduit plugin on Cloud Foundry can be used [to connect to a PostgreSQL database from your local machine](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/postgresql/#connect-to-a-postgresql-service-from-your-local-machine)

If you don't want to use Conduit, you can [connect to a backing service via an SSH tunnel from your local machine](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/managing_apps.html#connecting-to-a-non-publicly-available-backing-service). You might want to do this is to access the Postgres via a GUI for example.

### Managing apps

PaaS hosted applications are run in a container. [Connecting using SSH](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/managing_apps.html#connecting-with-ssh) gives you secure access to the applications container.


### Documentation cross reference

Lots of how the infrastructure is created for this project has been made ontop of the shoulders of the Become a teacher team (BAT)
They have more comprehensive documentation that shouldn't be repeated but referenced for completness
