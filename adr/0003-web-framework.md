# Primary development language and framework

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

Within the DfE three programming languages are commonly used for implementation of software: JavaScript, C# and Ruby-on-Rails. Which programming language should we use for this project?

## Decision Drivers

* The existing team are Ruby developers and they have EYFS sector domain knowledge
* Ruby appears to be the favoured development language within the DfE
* The predecessor project, EYFS Reforms, was created using Ruby-on-Rails

## Considered Options

* Ruby-on-Rails
* C#/.net core
* JavaScript

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: [Ruby-on-Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), because it enables the delivery of the project with the existing team who have knowledge of the project landscape, challenges and domain knowledge.
